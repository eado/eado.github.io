Most cracked computer science majors that I know have blogs. I want to be a
cracked computer science major. Logical conclusion?

While Bayes is rolling in his grave, in all seriousness, I decided
that a blog would be the best way to keep myself accountable. As such, I have
a couple goals for what this blog should be:
- a way to track my progress
- reviews for experiences (e.g. classes, events, jobs)
- reviews for products/libraries
- a document expressing my learning journey
- a place to vent frustrations

I'm also thinking about being active on Twitter, but this is best for
long-form contentâ€”Twitter is a cesspool anyway.

In terms of schedule, I plan on posting at least weekly every Friday.
