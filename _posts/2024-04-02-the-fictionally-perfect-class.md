Everyone has their favorite college professor. When the chance arises to take
another of their classes, you pounce on it. What happens when it's a disappointment?

Fall 2022 was my first quarter at UCLA. As a new college student, I was
very excited to start my academic journey—however, I would have to register for
classes first. As new students, we were kind of given the bottom of the barrel
when selecting classes. They do reserve introductory classes for us, but I came
in with a lot of credits, so those were not to much avail (other than the
mandatory intro classes that didn't want to transfer). One of the only classes
that was open (that met a major requirement) was ECE 102, a signal processing class. At
the time, I had no interest whatsoever in anything hardware—let alone signal
processing! 

# The Myth

In Professor [Jonathan Kao](http://seas.ucla.edu/~kao/)'s first lecture, he shared this quote with us:
> Every signal has a spectrum and is determined by its spectrum. You can
> analyze the signal either in the time domain or the frequency domain. I think
> this qualifies as a Major Secret of the Universe.

> -- Professor Brad Osgood, Stanford University

While I don't remember much from ECE 102, I do remember how well Professor Kao
imbued intuition into his students. Fundamentals, such as the ability to
explore the frequency domain, opens up completely new ways of thinking. I
credit Professor Kao with this sort of awakening—making him one of my favorite college
professors of all time.

In spring 2023, he taught ECE 143, a neural signal processing class. I'm
pleased to report that this class was even better—
