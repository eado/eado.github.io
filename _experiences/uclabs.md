As a member of [ACM Cyber](https://acmcyber.com), the 
[Muslim Student Association](https://www.msabruins.com/),
[Upsilon Pi Epsilon](https://ups.seas.ucla.edu) and many other organizations, I
had the privilege to be a part of a vibrant and ecstatic community.

While in school, I participated in [research](#research) under Professor 
[Graeme Blair](https://graemeblair.com/) studying AI/ML techniques to parse through
thousands of research articles. I also spent some time on the other side of academia; 
I was a [grader](#grader) for UCLA's machine learning class under Professors
[Aditya Grover](https://aditya-grover.github.io/), 
[Sriram Sankararaman](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/), and
[Suhas Diggavi](https://www.licos.ee.ucla.edu/).

Perhaps my most favorite time was being a [learning assistant](#learning) 
(similar to an undergraduate teaching assistant) for UCLA's networking class 
under Professor [Lixia Zhang](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~lixia). I ran two 
discussions every week where I taught students the basics of networking,
cryptography, and protocol design through carefully designed slides and 
activities. See more at on [my class webpage](https://eado.me/cs118).

Graduating *cum laude* in just two years, I took classes ranging from advanced 
Computer Architecture to Neural Signal Processing from some of the best professors in 
the nation. Notes from my time are available on 
[my Notion site](https://omarelamri.notion.site).
