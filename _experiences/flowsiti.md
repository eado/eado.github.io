Flowsiti is a groundbreaking application that manages enterprise workflows 
in an easy to use interface. Provides integrations with industry standards
such as Salesforce and Hubspot.

My responsibility lies with modernizing Flowsiti's infrastructure. I migrated
their single instance AWS EC2 server to Cloudflare Pages. One feature of 
Flowsiti is real-time collaboration with WebSockets&mdash;this 
functionality is implemented using Cloudflare's Durable Objects to sync state
across Workers' instances.
